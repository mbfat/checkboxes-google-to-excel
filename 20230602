I strongly advise against using check boxes in Excel if you already have the data as TRUE/FALSE in a cell. Check box controls are meant to be for user forms, and even though they can be placed in the spreadsheet grid, they live in a layer on top of the spreadsheet. Yes, they can be linked to a spreadsheet cell, but this is cumbersome.
Instead of using a macro that inserts a check box for each data row you could use a helper column with a formula along the lines of

=IF(D3=TRUE, "a", "r")
=IF([@checkBoxField],"a","r")

Then format the helper column with the Marlett font, which will show the letter "a" as a tick and the letter "r" as a cross.

Applying a formula like this will be much faster than inserting check box controls into each row and linking them to the field cells.
